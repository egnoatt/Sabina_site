## 📌 Rules & Best Practices

- **Do not** submit content changes (texts, images, articles) without authorization — those are © Sabina Scattola.  
- Contributions should focus on **technical aspects**: accessibility, performance, SEO, code quality, styling improvements.  
- Run `npm run lint` before submitting your PR.  
- Be respectful and constructive in discussions.
